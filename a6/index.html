  <p class="paragraph">For my final project, I will be creating a proposal website to host the 2023 International Tuba-Euphonium Conference at the University of Miami. This organization holds a conference once every two years, and it attracts the most renowed musicians and educators from all around the globe. Since there is much competition for hosting the event, a proposal must be comprehensive and stylish to be considered, and must effectively communicate why the host school and city is best-suited for the task.</p>

In addition, there will be a short quiz that visitors can take to test their knowledge.</p>
